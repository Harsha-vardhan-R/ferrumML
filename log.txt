25-09-'23(00:21) though to maintain a log, just implemented the multinomial naive bayes but i still need to implement to split and count the words in the data_frame.rs, so we can barely make any progrress for this until then 
                 but i will be trying other algorithms tho, and also i think we need to write another fit method for this called smooth_fit, which actually smoothes the curve , this laplacian smoothing is shit bro 
                 but anyways thats it for today.
